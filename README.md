# GuessMyNumber

GuessMyNumber is a simple game written in C#.

# Questions and answers:

Q: Why it is so much simple?

<br />

A: Because I'm a beginner on C# and I practice C#. Nothing more.

<br />

Q: Also, that's common. Many people already did this. Why don't you do something unique and useful?

<br />

A: Because I want to show how I wrote that game. And once again, I practice C#. I don't care if I do something simple and common.
